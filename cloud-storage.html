<!-- 1. Sync.com
A secure cloud storage service at a reasonable price
Pros

Great security & privacy
Reasonable prices
Extensive sharing functionality
Cons

No monthly plans
Clunky interface
Sync.com tops our list of the best cloud storage by focusing heavily on security while not sacrificing too much when it
comes to advanced features. Unfortunately, though, its end-to-end encryption means that its upload and download speeds
are on the slower side.

The service is zero-knowledge, meaning only you can decrypt your files. Given the extensive security, the service is
also priced very reasonably, though there are no monthly plans, which can be a problem for some users.

It also offers mobile apps for iOS and Android, allowing you to access your files on the go. Sync.com also includes
extensive sharing functionality, as you can adjust all sorts of settings for your shared links, such as download limits,
email notifications and passwords.

2. pCloud
Feature-rich and fast cloud storage at an excellent price
Pros

Lifetime plans
Sync your existing file structure
Extensive file-sharing features
Cons

Encryption purchased separately
No document integration
pCloud is our pick for the best online storage for photos that isn’t a dedicated photo storage solution. It’s good for
much more than just photos, though, as it’s an incredibly easy to use cloud storage service with file syncing that
allows you to keep your existing folder structure. File sharing can be done in multiple ways, and you even get usage
statistics for your shared files.

If you like pCloud and know that you’ll be using it for a long time, its lifetime plans make it the cheapest cloud
storage out there, as you get 500GB of storage in perpetuity for a one-time fee of $175.

Unfortunately, you have to pay extra for zero-knowledge encryption, which is an unusual move, to say the least. If you
do pay for it, though, you ensure that your files can’t be decrypted by pCloud and handed over to a third party.

3. Tresorit
Business storage focused on security and privacy
Pros

Great security & privacy
Compatible with most devices
Fantastic user management
Cons

Expensive
No block-level file sync
Tresorit is another cloud storage service with a heavy emphasis on security. To this end, it offers strong
zero-knowledge encryption, two-factor authentication and a very clear privacy policy. It’s a bit more expensive than
most other entries on this list, though, with a price tag of $12 per user for its cheapest plan.

Tresorit is primarily intended for businesses and professional use, but private individuals can still sign up for the
service, though they’ll find a lot of the features (such as advanced controls for groups and users) not very useful. The
software is compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, iOS and Linux, which means you’ll be able to use it pretty much
regardless of what device you have.

4. Icedrive
Cheap cloud-based storage focused on ease of use
Pros

Great interface design
Solid security & privacy
Reasonable prices
Generous free plan
Cons

Somewhat lacking in features
No offline access to files
No collaboration tools
Icedrive stands out mainly due to its beautiful interface design, which makes it a pleasure to use, as well as its
excellent prices. It offers more free storage than most other services (10GB), and its 1TB plan is only $4.19 per month
if you sign up for a full year. Unfortunately, it’s a bit light on features, so if you’re looking for a lot of advanced
functionality, Icedrive might not be for you.

Icedrive’s approach to cloud storage is unusual in that there’s no actual file syncing going on. Instead, your files are
kept purely on the cloud while the ones you see on your device are merely icons that download the file in real time when
you open it. Although this does free up space locally on your device, it also means you won’t have offline access to
your files.

Flextech Inc.
What We Like
Huge storage amount.

Quick account creation.

Advanced sharing options.

4 GB /file upload limit.

What We Don't Like
Recipients who want to download your files are forced to make an account.

Most competitive services don't offer a massive amount of storage. If it's free, and there's something they want you to
buy, it's clear you won't get the best of the best at no cost.

What makes TeraBox (formerly called Dubox) unique is that it provides a whopping 1 TB (1024 GB) for free. You can share
files with an automatic expiration date and even require a password before the recipient can download it.

Files can be uploaded individually or in bulk via folder uploads. Everything is automatically organized into sections to
make it easy to find pictures, videos, music, etc.

Paying for premium gets you twice the storage space, faster downloads, max video playback quality, 20 GB upload size
limit, no ads, and more.

There's an app for Windows, Android, and iOS. -->

                    easy to use, offers a generous free plan and is compatible with most devices. It’s also one of the
                    most secure cloud storage services out there, with end-to-end encryption and two-factor
                    authentication. The only downside is that it’s not as cheap as some of the other services on this
