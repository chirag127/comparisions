<!-- Cloud storage services are great for sharing files with friends and families, keeping documents in sync between all of
your devices, and so much more. Free cloud storage is even better!

Yes, there really are no-strings-attached, free online storage services out there. Many of them, actually. While nearly
all have premium offerings that provide more space, the free options are usually more than enough for most people,
especially if you use more than one.

Better yet, many of these providers give you even more free space for referring friends or performing other tasks.

Cloud storage is different from automatic cloud backup. The services listed below are great for keeping your files
online for storage, sharing, and playback, but they won't back up your computer files online on a schedule like a backup
service will. If that's what you're looking for, head to the end of this article.

MEGA

Mega Limited
What We Like
Lots of storage space.

Share public folders.

Mobile and desktop apps.

Clean and modern look.

What We Don't Like
Slow to prepare files for download.

Bandwidth limitations.

Might reduce storage capacity if you don't complete achievements.

You can get up to 20 GB of free cloud storage with MEGA. It offers secure end-to-end encryption to help combat a breach
of privacy. If you complete tasks, you can get the full 20 GB without paying.

One interesting feature is the ability to share links in a way where the recipient needs a second part of the URL,
basically like a password, before they can decrypt the information.

View and update your files through a browser, the desktop sync client, or the mobile app, so it can run on a variety of
platforms like Android, iOS, Windows, and others.

What We Like
More free storage than most services.

Multimedia streaming.

No speed or file size limit.

What We Don't Like
Lacks file sharing security for free accounts.

pCloud offers 10 GB. There's a desktop client for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. There's also a mobile app
that's very intuitive and easy to use.

It supports adding files from a remote URL in addition to single file and whole folder uploads through a browser. The
mobile apps can upload photos and videos directly to your account.

Both files and folders can be shared with non-users. Shared folders can even be downloaded as a ZIP archive.

This service also lets you generate upload links for folders so anyone can send files to your account. A unique email
address also allows you (or anyone) to email files directly to a folder on your pCloud account.

In addition to the above, you can back up the photos from your social media accounts like Facebook and Instagram.

This app runs on iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows, and more.

Filen Cloud Dienste UG
What We Like
All the same features as the paid plans (except for storage).

Mobile and desktop apps.

Advanced link sharing.

You can preview media files.

What We Don't Like
Issues installing the desktop app.

If you want the benefits of a zero-knowledge cloud storage service without losing features or compromising on space,
Filen is right up your alley. You'll get 10 GB of space at no cost, but you can upgrade to a paid plan or invite friends
for more storage.

We love the features here! The web app supports folder uploads, you can pause uploads even in the web app, it keeps old
file versions, you can share files with others even if they aren't Filn users (and media files can be streamed from a
share), keeping track of your public links is easy, and files/folders can be favorited for easy access again. Of course,
we can't forget to also mention 2FA and end-to-end encryption.

Besides web access, there's a mobile and desktop app for all platforms so you can upload and access your files from
anywhere.

What We Like
Upload large files.

Zero bandwidth limitations.

Supports guest accounts.

What We Don't Like
Account expires after inactivity.

Ad-supported website.

You can instantly get 10 GB of free online file hosting with MediaFire and increase it to 50 GB or more with things like
friend referrals and application downloads.

There are sharing options for files and folders, and easy uploads of either single files or whole entire folders through
the MediaFire website. A file upload can be as large as 4 GB. We also like the filtering options that make it simple to
find only your videos, docs, public files, etc.

Guest accounts are supported if you'd rather not make a user account to upload files. However, it's limited to 1 GB of
storage, and the files will be considered abandoned after 14 days of inactivity.

Mobile users can download an app to view and share files on the go or upload photos and videos.

You can use MediaFire on Android, iPhone, iPad, or a computer.

What We Like
Earn lots of free storage.

Intuitive file and folder sharing.

What We Don't Like
Small storage space.

Bandwidth limits on shared folders.

Our Review of Dropbox
Dropbox users start off with 2 GB of free space with several simple ways of earning more, up to around 18 GB.

You can view and upload all your Dropbox files from a desktop or mobile app and share whole folders with anyone, even if
they don't have a Dropbox account.

If you have Microsoft Office files stored in your Dropbox account, you can edit them from inside your browser for free
using Microsoft Office Online. Another unique feature is conversions—right-click a PowerPoint presentation, for example,
and you're able to save all the slides to separate image files.

Some features cost.

No password option for shared files.

10 GB of free online storage space is provided by Box (formerly Box.net).

There's a mobile application for nearly all devices that lets you upload/download/share your content. The desktop sync
client also makes it super simple to upload files to Box. Free users have a 250 MB file upload limit.

Box users can share whole folders of data or pick single files to share with a public link.

This one gives out a 20 GB of free storage to anyone who makes an account. If you have lots of friends who want to use
Degoo to store their files, you can get 5 GB more by referring them to make an account.

Google
What We Like
Super user-friendly website.

Collaboration and file sharing.

Plenty of free storage.

Desktop and mobile apps.

What We Don't Like
Shared storage with other Google services.

Bare desktop sync client.

Google Drive is the cloud storage service offered by Google. Each new user gets 15 GB of free space.

The total storage is actually shared with other Google services, like Gmail and Google Photos. If you don't use these
services, you can utilize almost all the space for Google Drive alone. Keep in mind that your file from Google Docs,
Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Photos, Gmail, etc. all compete for that free allotment.

Desktop users can install a sync client, which supports folder and file uploads. There's also a mobile app that can send
photos and videos to your account.

Folders and files can be shared with specific Google users via their email address or anyone with a public link. You can
also make a file view-only, which prevents someone from downloading it.

Google Drive makes it really simple to collaborate with others. You can allow comments on a document or let files be
opened and accessed by more than one person at a time. Since Google Workspace is available for everyone, you can also
give collaborators admin control over file sharing via trust rules.

Get it for iPhone, iPad, Android, or your Mac or Windows computer.

What We Like
Works with Microsoft Office Online.

Many ways to upload files.

Control how files are shared.

Earn more storage for free.

What We Don't Like
Less storage than similar services.

How to Use OneDrive
OneDrive is an online storage service from Microsoft. Everyone gets 5 GB of free space when they sign up.

Extra hosting is awarded if you follow certain instructions, like friend referrals and mobile photo syncing.

A desktop program lets you easily transfer folders and files of any type, making them accessible from a mobile device.
The mobile app can also upload files—both images and videos.

It supports sharing both folders and files with non-registered users, and you can grant full editing privileges or
viewing only via permissions.

You can get the OneDrive app for Windows, Android, iPhone, and iPad.

What We Like
Features not found elsewhere.

Good amount of storage.

Upload mobile images automatically.

Lots of apps.

What We Don't Like
Lots of website ads.

Buy extra storage.

Cannot upload folders with the web app.

Yandex is a Russian company known mainly for its popular Yandex Search and Yandex Email services, but they also have
others like Yandex Disk. It offers 10 GB of free cloud storage for anyone who creates an account.

There are plenty of useful features, such as public and private folder and file sharing, the ability to import photos
via social networks, bulk downloads, automatic mobile uploads, and support for drag and drop.

You can upgrade/pay to get 100 GB or more of space, or monitor bonus space promotions for free upgrades.

Windows, Mac, and Linux users can install a desktop program to upload files to Yandex Disk, and a mobile app is
available for Android, iPhone, and iPad.

What We Like
Complete tasks to earn more free space.

Web-based folder uploads.

Collaborate with team folders.

Password protect shares.

What We Don't Like
Not ideal for large files like videos.

Can't pause web uploads.

Minimal but functional website.

You get 5 GB of free cloud storage when you sign up for Sync.

Like some of the other services on this list, it can upload multiple files at once through both the website interface
and the mobile and desktop apps.

You can build shared folders that other users can interact with as well as share any folder or file with anyone,
regardless if they're a Sync user.

Vault is a folder that you can put files into so they aren't synced across your other devices. This is useful if you
just want to archive some files online but don't need them elsewhere.

See Sync's features page for a list of its features and some comparisons between the free and pro versions.

This service is available from the web; Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP; and macOS 10.11 and newer; plus iPhone,
iPad, and Android.

Blomp

Blomp
What We Like
Lots of free storage with opportunities for more.

Programs are easy to use.

Works with all the popular platforms.

No upload size limit.

What We Don't Like
Barebones apps; few features.

Must download media files to view them from your account.

Can't share files.

Account deletion alert after 30 days.

Blomp is a free file storage site that provides a whopping 20 GB of storage to anyone who signs up.

The website and program are super slim with few features; you can create folders, upload files, and download your
backed-up data. However, this makes them really easy to use and free from clutter, so it could be considered a good
thing.

There isn't a limit to how large a file can be when you upload it as long as it doesn't exceed 20 GB (since that's the
total storage amount). Bulk uploads are supported as well, from the website and app.

The website, desktop app, and mobile app won't preview the image files you've uploaded. You have to first download them
to your phone or computer to see what they are. Most cloud backup tools let you preview videos, music, and images, so
it's unfortunate this service doesn't work quite the same way.

However, 20 GB isn't bad at all when it's free. Plus, you can get up to 200 GB of free space if you refer friends to
sign up.

Blomp runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux, as well as iOS and Android mobile devices.

LetsUpload

Letsupload
What We Like
Unlimited free file storage.

Zero download or upload speed caps.

Upload files as large as 15 GB.

What We Don't Like
Files in free accounts expire after 30 days.

Overwhelming number of pop-up ads.

Setting up the desktop client isn't easy.

LetsUpload is vastly different than all the other cloud storage sites in this list because you get unlimited backup
space...for free. Whether you need 10 GB, 1 TB, or 100 TB, it's far more than most sites offer.

Even though there's nearly no limit to how much you can save in your account, you're not going to miss out on neat
features either. It lets you set a password for files and folders, send a file to someone over the built-in email
function, upload files by their URL, share files with anyone, stream media files straight from your account, and copy
share links in bulk.

The website also has a Search Files feature where you can locate thousands of files, like images, videos, and documents,
that are shared by other users.

Some of the differences between a free and premium account are the max upload size, when the account becomes inactive,
ads, FTP and torrent upload support, and the time you have to wait between downloads.

You can access your account via WebDAV. There are directions on their site for doing this on Windows, Mac, Linux,
Android, iOS, and BlackBerry devices. However, we were unable to get this working correctly and could only access our
account from their website.

Internxt

Internxt
What We Like
Zero-knowledge encryption.

Free from ads.

Direct file sharing (goes right to the file).

Cheap plans if you want more space.

What We Don't Like
Web app doesn't support folder uploads.

No trash folder in case you need to undelete something.

Can't move files between folders.

You can get another 2 GB of free storage when you sign up for Internxt. It's advertised as more secure than most other
cloud storage services because it offers zero-knowledge encryption, which means that only you ever see your files. Even
the site owner and workers can't access your data.

There isn't much to the website but a few buttons along the top for you to upload files, make new folders, search, and
share things. When you share, you get a link that, when clicked, starts the download immediately. Recipients aren't
looking around for a download button, which is really nice. You can also specify how many times each file can be
downloaded.

The design of your folders can be customized, so you can choose a special icon or color to make them stand out from the
rest. There isn't really a function to this, but it's a nice addition that most file storage sites don't allow.

Something we don't like is that you can't easily move files from one folder to another through the web app. If you get
the desktop app, you can delete something from one folder and put it into another, but it forces a reupload instead of a
simple move.

You can unlock up to 10 GB of total space by completing things like installing the app, sharing a file, inviting
friends, and subscribing to their newsletter.

Your data can be accessed from their website or the app for your computer, phone, or tablet.

Icedrive
What We Like
Has a helpful portable app for computers.

Lets you stream audio/video and preview PDFs and other documents.

Stores old versions of your files.

What We Don't Like
Encryption and advanced link sharing aren't free.

Limits bandwidth to 3 GB per day.

Icedrive provides 10 GB of free cloud storage. Your files are accessible through a really nice desktop program, mobile
app, and website.

You can stream your music and videos straight from your account without having to re-download the files. This is also
true for people you share your files with. They don't even need to be Icedrive users to download and stream the files
you share.

There are also options to favorite specific files to quickly access them from the Favorites tab, control bandwidth in
the desktop program, share via email addresses or public links, and download old versions of files you've made changes
to.

Other features are supported, like encryption, password-protected share links, and WebDAV, but they aren't free to use.

This app works on Android, iPhone, and iPad devices. There's also a fully installable desktop program that makes your
account look like a locally attached hard drive for easy use. A portable version for Windows, Mac, and Linux is
available as well.

Infrequent app updates.

Hundreds of file types can be uploaded to Jumpshare, with a total of 2 GB of free storage for every user. If you refer

The upload limit per file is 250 MB. The desktop program also lets you take screenshots and record your screen for one

What We Like
Unlimited photo storage.

What We Don't Like
Free only for Prime members.

Amazon.com has an online storage service called Amazon Photos, which offers Prime members unlimited, full-res photo
storage plus 5 GB of space for videos.

Users can share files to create a public link accessible by anyone who uses it, even if they don't have an Amazon
account. You can share albums, too, but bulk downloading by the recipient isn't allowed.

Files can be uploaded using the desktop client software or the web version, though only the former allows folder
uploads. A mobile app is also available for uploading videos and photos from Android and iOS devices.

TeraBox

Flextech Inc.
What We Like
Huge storage amount.

Quick account creation.

Advanced sharing options.

4 GB /file upload limit.

What We Don't Like
Recipients who want to download your files are forced to make an account.

Most competitive services don't offer a massive amount of storage. If it's free, and there's something they want you to
buy, it's clear you won't get the best of the best at no cost.

What makes TeraBox (formerly called Dubox) unique is that it provides a whopping 1 TB (1024 GB) for free. You can share
files with an automatic expiration date and even require a password before the recipient can download it.

Files can be uploaded individually or in bulk via folder uploads. Everything is automatically organized into sections to
make it easy to find pictures, videos, music, etc.

Paying for premium gets you twice the storage space, faster downloads, max video playback quality, 20 GB upload size
limit, no ads, and more.

There's an app for Windows, Android, and iOS. -->
